checkpoint_manager.py

This is the failure-recovery strategy: after every batch is loaded to
staging and successfully MERGEd into its target table, we commit a
checkpoint row (last primary key seen, last batch index, run_id) to
the migration_checkpoint BigQuery table. If a table's pipeline run
fails partway through, the checkpoint from its last successful batch
is still sitting there.

On the NEXT cycle, before extracting a table we read its checkpoint:
  - status == "COMPLETED"  -> table finished cleanly last time.
  - status == "FAILED" or "IN_PROGRESS" (a run that crashed mid-table
    never got to write COMPLETED) -> resume extraction starting right
    after last_pk_json instead of from the top, so we don't re-pull
    and re-merge millions of already-migrated rows. Because the load
    path is a MERGE (see bq_merge.py), even re-processing the batch
    that was in flight when it failed is safe — it just overwrites the
    same rows, never duplicates them.
