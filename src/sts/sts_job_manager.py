"""

sts_job_manager.py
 
Triggers a one-time run of a transfer job and polls until it

finishes — this is what the Airflow task actually calls, so the DAG

doesn't move on to the BigQuery load until the transfer is really done.
 
IMPORTANT: the job-level status (operation.done()/result() succeeding)

only means the transfer JOB ran to completion — it does NOT mean every

object inside it was actually copied. Storage Transfer Service tracks

per-object failures (auth errors, missing source objects, etc.)

separately in the operation's `counters` / `error_breakdowns`, without

failing the job itself. So we inspect those explicitly and only report

"SUCCESS" when everything the job found was actually copied.
