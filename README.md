# Migration Accelerator — Python + Airflow Edition

Fully code-driven, fully dynamic version of the accelerator: real
Python modules per concern, orchestrated by two Airflow DAGs, designed
to run in Cloud Composer (no local machine required — build/test it
via Google Cloud Shell). Talks only to real SQL Server — the earlier
SQLite demo path has been removed entirely.

## What "dynamic" means here

Nothing about which tables to migrate, their columns, or their primary
keys is hand-typed anywhere in this repo:

- **Tables & primary keys** — `src/discovery/table_discovery.py` reads
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` / key-constraint catalog views straight off SQL
  Server every run. Add a table to the source database and it's picked
  up on the next run with zero code or config change.
- **load_mode** — every table's planned mode is `"full"` by default
  (`src/planner/table_planner.py`), meaning it's picked up by
  `migration_dag.py`. Override a table to `"incremental"` in
  `config/tables_override.yaml` to have it picked up by
  `incremental_dag.py`'s schedule instead, to periodically re-check for
  newly appended rows. `config/tables_override.yaml` is *optional* —
  only touch it to force a specific table's load_mode, or exclude a table.
- **Insert-only, no watermark column** — the source data is static
  (existing rows never change, only new ones get appended), so there
  is no watermark column anywhere in this pipeline. Every MERGE
  matches purely on primary key and only has a `WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT` branch — rows already present in the target are left
  completely untouched, regardless of load_mode. See
  `src/bigquery/bq_merge.py`.
- **No partitioning or clustering** — target and staging tables are
  created as plain BigQuery tables.
- **`config/tables.yaml`** — a read-only snapshot of the current plan
  (table, primary key, load_mode), rewritten by `table_planner.py` on
  every run purely for visibility. Never hand-edit it and nothing reads
  it back in — delete it any time, it just reappears next run.
- **Batching, not partitioning** — large tables are no longer split by
  ranges of a business column. Every table is paged by its own primary
  key (keyset/seek pagination, `src/extraction/sql_extractor.py`), so
  one Parquet file is produced per page (`table_part0000.parquet`,
  `table_part0001.parquet`, ...), each capped at
  `extraction.batch_size` rows in `config/settings.yaml`.
- **BigQuery objects** — target table, staging table, and the three
  operational tables below are all created with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
  EXISTS` from a schema built dynamically off the source (see
  `src/bigquery/bq_control_tables.py`). Target/staging tables are plain
  — no partitioning, no clustering.

                                                         config/tables.yaml as a read-only snapshot of it

src/reporting (report_generator)                     <- rolls up migration_audit into one row per
                                                         table (latest status + live row count) —
                                                         writes it as a real BigQuery table AND a
                                                         local JSON snapshot under logs/reports/

src/pipeline/table_pipeline.py  <- the one place the whole chain above is wired together;
                                    main.py and both DAGs all call this, so there's one code path, not three.

dags/migration_dag.py       <- discovers full-load tables at task runtime, fans out with dynamic task
                                mapping, then generates the tablewise report once every table is done
dags/incremental_dag.py     <- same, for incremental tables (staging + insert-only merge on a schedule)
main.py                     <- runs one table through the chain manually (or --report / --list), no Airflow needed
```

## Failure recovery (checkpoint + insert-only MERGE)

Every batch is loaded to a staging table and then `MERGE`d into the
target on the table's real (possibly composite) primary key — never a
truncate-and-reload, and with no `WHEN MATCHED` branch at all (see
"Insert-only" above). After each batch's MERGE succeeds,
`checkpoint_manager.py` commits the last primary key seen to the
`migration_checkpoint` BigQuery table.

If a table's run fails partway through, the next cycle reads that
checkpoint and resumes extraction right after the last committed
primary key — it does not restart the table from batch 0. Because the
MERGE is insert-only and matches on primary key, re-running (resuming)
a batch that already landed is always a safe no-op: every row in it
already exists in the target by primary key, so nothing gets
duplicated or overwritten. `migration_audit` records one row per table
per run showing whether that run was a fresh `SUCCESS`, a
`RESUMED_SUCCESS` (picked up after a prior failure), or a `FAILED` run.

## Logs and reporting

Three layers, from most granular to most readable:

1. **Raw events (JSON)** — one immutable JSON object per stage event,
   under `logs/raw/<run_id>/<event_id>.json` locally, or
   `gcs://<bucket>/pipeline_logs/raw/<run_id>/<event_id>.json` in
   production (default; survives across Composer workers).
2. **`migration_pipeline_logs`** (BigQuery table) — the same events,
   queryable with SQL instead of grepping JSON files.
3. **`migration_report`** (BigQuery table) — the tablewise summary:
   one row per table showing its latest run's outcome plus its actual
   current row count in BigQuery right now. Regenerated fresh (not
   appended) every time it runs — `src/reporting/report_generator.py`.
   Also drops a dated local JSON copy under `logs/reports/`.

Generate/refresh the report any time with:
```
python3 main.py --report
```
It also runs automatically as the last task of `migration_dag.py`,
after every table in that run has finished (success or failure).

## Running this without a local machine (Cloud Shell only)

1. Open console.cloud.google.com → activate Cloud Shell (top-right terminal icon).
2. Upload or clone this project into Cloud Shell's home directory (drag-and-drop into
   the Cloud Shell file browser, or `git clone` if it's in a repo).
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Fill in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`) with your real SQL Server/Azure/GCP values.
5. See what gets discovered before running anything: `python3 main.py --list`
6. Test one table manually: `python3 main.py --table customers`
7. Once that works, deploy the DAGs to Composer:
   ```
   gcloud composer environments storage dags import \
     --environment <your-composer-env> --location <region> \
     --source dags/migration_dag.py
   ```
   Also upload the `src/` and `config/` folders into Composer's DAG bucket
   (same bucket, alongside `dags/`) since the DAG files import from them.
8. Trigger the DAG from the Airflow UI (linked from your Composer environment
   in the GCP Console) and watch it run.
